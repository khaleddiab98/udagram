# Pipeline Process
Upon editing the project source code and pushing it to GitHub, the CircleCI platform triggers a flag that starts the pipeline. First, the dependencies are re-installed for both the frontend and backend. Then, the build scripts for both ends are triggered. An AWS S3 command is then run to deploy the newly built frontend from the ‘Archive.zip’. Last, using the Elastic Beanstalk CLI, we send the AWS Secrets as environment variables to EB and then deploy the fresh backend build to the elastic beanstalk environment. This ensures that the latest version of the project source code is deployed.
